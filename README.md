# PriceDrop
This repository contains the iOS app of the Moda app. Moda is a new way to shop and save all your items in one place from different websites. Whenever price drops on any of the items you saved, we send out a notification to you.

The backend of this app is running on Heroku Apps and is auto-deployed from the repository at https://github.com/ayush-patel/PriceDropBackend
